#Version 2.2 : 2023-08-03

Started work on the parallelization of the simulations.  
Continued work on the random destination of the cars but got stuck to a loop so switched over to parallelization.  

Minor changes to env.py to reflect the structure of the other file's importing structure.  
Also added a step by step guide on the README.md file of how the program can run with simple steps.
